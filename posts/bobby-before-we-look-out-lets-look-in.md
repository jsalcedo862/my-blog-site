It is with great pleasure I write this first post on the website about one of my favorite DJs & Producer.
Bobby. a resident at London's iconic Fabric nightclub and founder of the Pleasure Club record label has been making a huge impact in the elctronic music scene. A few years ago, I came across Bobby.'s mix on Francesco Del Garda's Soundcloud Timeless Series and it peaked my interest. What unraveled before me was something I never experienced before.

For as long as I can remember, I make it a habit to listen to a DJ live before passing any judgement on their music. However, after listening to Bobby.'s Timeless mix I began to look deeper into him and could not help the connection I started to develop to his music. Before I knew it, Bobby. was one of my favorite DJs and I had never heard him play live. To top it all off, Bobby. was supposed to play the recent Can You Jigit? party in NYC this past May and his flight got delayed. I was really bummed out that I couldn't hear him play but I saw him on the dancefloor. I have never met a DJ so willing to have a nice chat with a random person on the dancefloor. I spoke to him about my Houghton experience and even got to pick his brain about what he thinks upcoming DJs should be doing to succeed in today's market. Although I still have not heard him play live, today I have even more of a connection to him and his music and will forever hold dear to my heart our dance floor chat that took place at 7am inside NYC's H0l0 venue.

This upcoming Pleasure Club release is a perfect representation of his ability to curate something new and completely his own. This release takes the listener through a dark, eclectic journey that also blends these emotional yet trippy characteristics in the best way I could imagine. Within a short period of time of Bobby. announcing that pre-orders were live, the pre-orders were sold out.

Take a listen and be on the lookout for the release date if you are interested in a vinyl copy.
