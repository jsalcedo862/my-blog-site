Reformed Society (Harsh Puri), a DJ and producer currently living in Barcelona, delivers this brilliant EP for the O.C.D record label. The A side "Creature In The Shadows" is a track I could listen to on repeat. It's one of the records I find myself quite in love with. Consisting of all the elements that make a record amazing like these atmospheric soundscapes and rhythms, dark/trippy vibe yet progressive and emotional at the same time. Its complexity and blend of different elements keep me coming back. On the B side, the two tracks "Soaring" and Sinking Lights" provide a similar vibe. B1 Soaring being this clean techno track and B2 Sinking Lights a more atmospheric hazy record with these tribal like percussive elements along with soundscapes and pads that puts the listener in a state of trance.
